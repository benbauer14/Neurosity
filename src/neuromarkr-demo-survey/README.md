# Background
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Then, I followed along the tutorial [linked here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rUNwg-rc2g&t=0s).
- The survey JSON objects were built using [SurveyJS's Survey Builder](https://surveyjs.io/create-survey) tool, survey items are focused on Opioid Use Disorder and mental health assessments and treatments. 
- Currently, survey data are ```console.log()```'d as a JSON output object upon completing the survey; this is where data would be sent to a database.

# Getting started
